It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar <br/>System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet <br/>that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is the second-<br/>densest satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities are known.
